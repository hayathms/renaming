Removing White Space From File Names Recursively 


This file actively replaces any string from file names recursively.


How to run?

imagine we have a huge collection of Music with more than 2000K files and all are with empty white space giving lot of 
unwanted problem during various operations, so


python rename.py /home/john/Music/
